        It is found by research that small kids who are in playgroups or nursery learn better with the visuals and pictorial representations, and with the Audio Visual study, you can easily interact with them and make them understand better the things. The drawings onboard or carrying the huge posters are not feasible and effective normally so presenting the real images, videos and music can make the Study time fun and interesting for them and the concepts will be kept in mind forever through this way. Also, the backbenchers won’t feel left out and everyone can easily view and participate in class.
        <br> <br> <u>
        Better time management:
    </u> <br> <br>

       <br> <br>
        Also during the lecture, if you focus on continuously writing what the teacher is saying then the ¬¬understanding of the topic may get affected and you may get lost in between. Copying from other students is also a task because everyone’s notes are good for them and you may not understand completely what the idea is.With the Edu On Wheels, you have clear important points given and don’t have to figure out the concept from unnecessary writings in notes.

        The basic problem for a teacher is that he or she cannot arrange all the teaching aids required as it is time consuming, costly and difficult to present in the given 40 to 45 minutes time frame. Hence it is better to opt for Edu On Wheels aids helping the children learn better as they can visualise the information and co-relate with her message.

        The student-teacher ratio was a concern since longtime. This was more a problem in govt. as well as pvt institutes. During my school days, there were about sixty students in one class. The noise in the class, even if each only murmured, used to make our teacher say it looked like a market. However, things started changing and it became a general scene that each class has around 35 to forty students only.
       <br> <br> 
        In states like Kerala, even government schools  and other institutions have started having technical ways of studying. In about a few years this article will become irrelevant as everyone will be knowing what is it or they will be sending their children to Edu On Wheels.
